Asynchronous, smart, and complete customization:  papaya is a next-generation Anti-Cheat by Shawckz

## What is this?

This is an abandonded Anti-Cheat I had been working on.  

It was a pretty cool design, and the packet-based checks were promising, 
but it's been 2+ years since I last touched this project so I will be releasing it publicly without warranty.
There are no plans to finish this project.

## Disclaimer

I no longer consider this code to be to my standards, and this project will not be updated or maintained.

This is released without warranty, and you are free to use this at your own risk.

I provide no guarantee that this works whatsoever.
